            <h2>Body Scan</h2>
            
            <p>Before you go to sleep go from your toes to your head and try to flex and then release your muscle.
                This way you learn to realize when your body is tense. By teaching our mind to find the signs when our body is tensed we will feel the signs of a tensed shoulder during the bout and will be able to fix it fast.</p>

            <h3>What to do?</h3>
            <p>Flex and relax your muscles going in order from the bottom to the top: 

                toes, shins, quads, hips, abs, chest, fingers, arms, shoulders, neck, cheeks, teeth, eyes.
            </p>
            <h3>When to do it?</h3>
            <p>Before you go to sleep | When you meditate | Before Competitions</p>
            <h3>Why do it?</h3>
            <p>Many times we don't even realize how tense some of our muscles are. By scanning our body we train our mind to recognize the tension.</p>

            <h2>Write down your mind flow</h2>
    
            <p>Sometimes our mind is overwhelmed with all the emotions and thoughts that we are experiencing. Our mind is like a water glass, if it's already full it won't absorb any new information.
            If you feel anxious and unsettled put a time for 3 minutes, take a pen, a paper and start writing down.</p>
            
            <h3>What to do?</h3>
            <p> Put a timer on your phone for 3 minutes and start writing everything that comes to your mind. Don't think about it, just pour everything on the paper.
            </p>
            <h3>When to do it?</h3>
            <p>When you feel anxious or too nervous </p>
            <h3>Why do it?</h3>
            <p>Many times we are too stressed to meditate or focus. If that's the case "empty" you glass first.</p>

        <h2>Be aware of your guests. </h2>
        <p>We don't want to fight our emotions, we want to recognize when we start feeling angy or nervous, akgnowledge it and move on.
            Try to do this exercise for a day once a week - write down on your phone everytime you note an emotion entering your mind</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4G8gy_fbX8U?si=iUpzx8ZBVGKYyT0b" target="_blank">Watch Video</a>
            <h3>What to do?</h3>
            <p> Choose a day and write down a note on your phone everytime you feel a change in emotions. Write the time and the emotion.
                For example: 9:15am, felt irritated, was walking to buy groceries.
            </p>
            <h3>When to do it?</h3>
            <p>Do this exercise a few times during non competition period.</p>
            <h3>Why do it?</h3>
            <p>The more you pay attention to how your mind changes the more you feel comfortable with it.</p>

          <h2>Breath, breath, breath. </h2>
          <p>The main idea behind breathing is that our mind can't be in two places at the same time.
          So if we are concentrating on our breathing we won't be able to think about other things.There are tons of breathing techniques and they all have their advantages. Here I will shortly introduce one.</p>
          <h3>What to do?</h3>
          <p>Imagine a flashlight that lightens up inside you when you breath, count to 4 when you inhale. Hold for 2 seconds. Count to 4 when you exhale. 
            If you are during a competition you don't have to count but take a deep breath and imagine the flashlight, that will clear your mind for a second.
          </p>
          <h3>When to do it?</h3>
          <p> When you feel stressed | During rest to train the habbit | During a competition</p>
          <h3>Why do it?</h3>
          <p>Getting the habbit of taking a deep breath can help you to get more oxygen and to calm down faster during the competition.</p>

        <h2>Visualization </h2>
            <p>If you can dream it - you can do it. Our mind doesn't care whether we visualize our bout or it's happenning in real life.
                That's why it's important to visualize how you win, how you fence, how you enter the competition venue. We can trick our mind that 
                it's not a new situation but a familiar setting.
            </p>

        <h3>What to do?</h3>
          <p>Sit down and visualize for 2-3 minutes the competition venue and add as many details as you can.
            A more detailed picture will work better for our brain. How do you enter, how do you warm up, how does your epee feel, how ready you are.
            You can also work for more specific scenarios like - visualize priority touch, visualize a bout against someone, visualize yourself fighting in the final.
          </p>

          <h3>When to do it?</h3>
          <p> Train your mind regularly | Before the competition</p>
          
          <h3>Why do it?</h3>
          <p>Experience counts, so why not train your mind to feel familiar in the situations it matters the most?</p>

        </div>
        <p>You always lose more than you win in sports, so it's important to have a firm belief that the sky is always blue.
            Sometimes we need a reminder that we have the skills, so make yourself some reminders that show that you are good.
        </p>

        <h3>What to do?</h3>
        <p>Give yourself something visual that would showcase your achievments. Two options could be:
            Small bricks with your significant moments that build up your "confidence wall", add them as the time goes by even
            if no major events happened. Another option is to have some video compillations of good touches from your bouts.
