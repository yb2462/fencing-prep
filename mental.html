      <h2>Let's talk about mental strength...</h2>
      <p>Mental strenth is just as important as our technical skills or physical health. If we have the ability to perform under pressure, to make the right decision when it matters - we are able to win our bouts.
        Being mentally strong is not only about the decision making process, it includes also the ability to be present and read your opponent, to be indifferent to the loud environment, to quickly reset and change your tactics, and in the long run to be able to learn from your experiences.

      <strong>It's important to remember that our mind is just like any other muscle needs constant practice. By meditating we learn our mind to focus and listen to our body.</strong>
